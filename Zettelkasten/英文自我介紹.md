# 英文自我介紹

Hello, I'm 謝育声. I want to tell an interesting story which happened when I was in kindergarten. At that time, there was a static light box which is used for examining our eyesight. Although the sequence looks random,  there was actually a hidden pattern in it. I somehow memorized the pattern and used it for my eyesight exam. The teacher eventually found out my stunt with rage. I was then punished for my disobedience. However, the incident became a joke i have told over and over during self introduction.
