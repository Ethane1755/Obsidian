THE PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT

OF THE
**IRISH REPUBLIC**
TO THE PEOPLE OF IRELAND

IRISHMEN AND IRISHWOMEN: In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom.

Having organised and trained her manhood through her secret revolutionary organisation, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and through her open military organisations, the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army, having patiently perfected her discipline, having resolutely waited for the right moment to reveal itself, she now seizes that moment, and supported by her exiled children in America and by gallant allies in Europe, but relying in the first on her own strength, she strikes in full confidence of victory.

We declare the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible. The long usurpation of that right by a foreign people and government has not extinguished the right, nor can it ever be extinguished except by the destruction of the Irish people. In every generation the Irish people have asserted their right to national freedom and sovereignty; six times during the past three hundred years they have asserted it in arms. Standing on that fundamental right and again asserting it in arms in the face of the world, we hereby proclaim the Irish Republic as a Sovereign Independent State, and we pledge our lives and the lives of our comrades in arms to the cause of its freedom, of its welfare, and of its exaltation among the nations.

The Irish Republic is entitled to, and hereby claims, the allegiance of every Irishman and Irishwoman. The Republic guarantees religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and oblivious of the differences carefully fostered by an alien Government, which have divided a minority from the majority in the past.

Until our arms have brought the opportune moment for the establishment of a permanent National Government, representative of the whole people of Ireland and elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, the Provisional Government, hereby constituted, will administer the civil and military affairs of the Republic in trust for the people.

We place the cause of the Irish Republic under the protection of the Most High God, Whose blessing we invoke upon our arms, and we pray that no one who serves that cause will dishonour it by cowardice, inhumanity, or rapine. In this supreme hour the Irish nation must, by its valour and discipline, and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.

**[[愛爾蘭]]共和國臨時政府致愛爾蘭人民：**

愛爾蘭的每一位男士和女士們：以上帝及先烈們所宣揚她舊的民族傳統，愛爾蘭通過我們來召集她的後代，聚集在她的旗子之下，為她的自由而戰。

通過秘密組織：愛爾蘭共和黨兄弟會，她的剛毅得到了組織和訓練。並且藉由開放的軍事組織：愛爾蘭志願者和愛爾蘭公民軍隊，她耐心地完善她的紀律，堅定的等候好時機以便顯露自己。現在，她正把握這個好時機，並擁有她被流放至美國的子民們和歐洲忠勇的盟友支持。但首先得倚仗她自己的力量，以充分勝利的信心發起總攻。

我們宣布愛爾蘭人民的權利屬於所有愛爾蘭人。我們對愛爾蘭命運的控制是獨立自主和不能被廢除的。這些權力長期被外國民族和政府簒奪的狀況並沒有將它毀滅：除了愛爾蘭人的自為毀滅以外，無人可毀滅它。愛爾蘭的每一代人民一直都擁有他們的民族自由和獨立自主的權力；因此在過去的三百年內爆發了六次武裝行動。基於這些基本權利和再一次的武裝行動，我們特此宣告，愛爾蘭共和國是一個獨立自主的國家，並以我們及其他同志們的生命保證它的自由、福利、及民族的目標。

愛爾蘭共和國有權力並要求每一位愛爾蘭男士和女士的忠誠。共和黨保證宗教和公民自由，給予它每一位市民平等的權力和機會，並且追求整個國家的幸福和繁榮，平等的愛護所有孩童，並且謹慎的忘卻一個外國政府所建立的種族差異：它在過去已從多數中分裂出少數。

在我們的武裝行動為我們恰當地建立一個永久國家之前，依照愛爾蘭全體人民的代表和所有她的男士和女士的選舉結果，特以人民的信任來組成臨時政府，並將執行共和國民用和軍事事務。

我們將愛爾蘭共和國的目標置於最高上帝的保護之下。我們祈求祂保佑我們武裝行動的勝利，我們祈禱我們當中的每一位同志不會因為懦弱、喪失人性或掠奪而使我們的目的蒙羞。在這至關重要的時刻，愛爾蘭人民必須以它的勇氣、紀律及為大眾利益而準備犧牲的精神，向世人證明所謂「八月命運」的價值所在。
