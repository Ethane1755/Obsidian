> "understanding the chemistry of hot corinos is a crucial key to shed light on the conditions that favoured the emergence of life on our planet." ([Chahine et al 2021:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=1))

  

> "OMC-2 FIR 4, a protostellar cluster located in the Orion Molecular Cloud 2, at a distance of 39325 pc  (Grossschedl et al. 2018). It has a total mass of 30 M approx-  imately (Mezger et al. 1990; Crimier et al. 2009) and a bolometric luminosity 1000 L (Crimier et al. 2009; Furlan et al.   2014). Due to various properties, it is thought to be the closest analogue to the environment in which the Sun may have been born." ([Chahine et al 2021:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=2))

  

> "hot corino candidate HOPS-108 (Tobin et al. 2019) located within this protocluster can provide us with important hints about the chemistry of the gas and dust envelope surrounding our proto-Sun." ([Chahine et al 2021:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=2))

  

> "Herschel Orion Protostar Survey" ([Chahine et al 2021:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=2))

  

> "only HOPS-108 displays rich iCOM emission at these wavelengths, making it the only clear hot corino present in the protocluster." ([Chahine et al 2021:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=2))

  

> "In terms of the line number, our spectra are dominated by HCOOCH3" ([Chahine et al 2021:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=2))

  

> "3 0:5 1017 HCOOCH3 28 [83] 49-366 96 6.7  4.8-13.4 + +  3 0:5   " ([Chahine et al 2021:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=4))

  

> "The detection of a hot corino in what is currently considered to be the closest analogue of the Solar System birth environment" ([Chahine et al 2021:6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HFXEY9SN?page=6))
