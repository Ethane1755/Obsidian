The remaining 1% is composed of solid silicate and carbon-basedmm-sized dust particles present throughout interstellar clouds that provide surfaces for accretion of gas phase species and subsequent grain surface chemistry" ([Ehrenfreund and Cami 2010:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y8987LBM?page=3))

At 10 K only H, D, C, O, and N atoms have sufficient mobility to interact on the surfaces of grains." ([Ehrenfreund and Cami 2010:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/Y8987LBM?page=3))
