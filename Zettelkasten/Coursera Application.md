To whom it may concern:

The "Michigan University infographics course" enables me to jigsaw tiny bits of data and information into extremely useful conclusions. Companies from technology giants like Google and Amazon to Community firms which only serves rural areas all need infographics to decide which route their company might take to achieve more efficiency and goals. With these courses, I can get the essentials ideas to have a fundamental infographics skillset. My current career goal, since I am still a student, is to ensure as many abilities with divergences as possible. In order to fulfill my long term ambition, Coursera is the best resource I could find online. Thank you in advance for giving me and many others the chance to have a dreamlike education platform, and for the application of funds which helps many, including me, to have a resource normally unable for us to reach.

To whom it may concern:

Hello. I am a student in CKHS, Taipei City, Taiwan. I’m applying for the "Michigan University infographics course". Enrolling in this course enables me to have higher comprehension of Data Visualizing, The needed position in many companies around the globe. To cope with the fast-changing world by analyzing raw data into useful information is the ultimate objection that motivates me to enroll in this course, which is the best way to get these techniques according to many comments on the Web. But as a student, I don’t have any reliable sources of making money. Although my family will support me in these courses, there were some accidents that fell upon us recently, making my family unable to spare the tuition for this course. I sincerely appreciate your help, and will use your kindly funds to make a brighter future for myself, and humans altogether.
