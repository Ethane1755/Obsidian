### Life under the pandemic
Some people enjoy outdoor activities such as sports and traveling as their pastime, whereas others like to hang out indoors and relax with a group of friends. However, what if both options are brutally cut out by an unthinkable force? This is what we, high school students of 2022, face in our daily life.

COVID-19 is a contagious disease sparked by coronaviruses. It is widely known for its high transmission rate, which is the direct cause of the 2003 SARS and 2012 MERS pandemic. The coronavirus affect our life drastically and dramatically. For one thing, restrictions the government placed on us bans nearly all school and club activities for us. Many restrictions are what we hadn't think of before, or acts we thought will only happen in non-democratic countries. If we ask a graduate from 2018, he will never imagine all activities and memories he take for granted will be a hopeless dream an year later.

An annual and symbolic event for 9th grader, graduation ceremony, were replaced by an simple online video, which for graduates were disappointing and was also the biggest regret. Graduates like me were "quarantined" in our homes for approximately three and a half months. Not only did we lose the ordinarily youthful life, but we also let slip the last chance to meet with our old friends. Therefore, I can directly say that the pandemic has interrupted my whole holiday plan and has stifled the fun in the long summer vacation. 

Take our club, CKAC for example. We used to have about ten to fifteen cross-school activities per year. However, this year we and our seniors have only eight, and most of them have reduced time and attendees. Our seniors are unhappy and sorry about all the fuss being made around the pandemic, and the inconvenience it caused us. While we are discussing organizing events, we are often irritated by the inconvenience the pandemic bring us, and that lead to heated events.

Being victim of the century's worst pandemic, what we can do is fairly simple. As we cannot directly control the future of the pandemic, nor force the government to change their policies, we can only adjust our attitude toward it. Being optimistic can reduce the anxiety of everyone, therefore increase the possibilities of peaceful conversation.

Grab the hope and courage, as we march toward the unthinkable future.
