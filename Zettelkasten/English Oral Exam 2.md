When I was a little boy, I was awed by stories of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, or Larry Page, who helped the world become a much better place. Therefore, my dream career is to be a maker who innovate technology-enhanced product for a living.

This difficult career requires me two abilities. The first is imagination, an ability I have had long long time ago. However, my imagination have decreased over time due to socialization. The way to get back my imagination is to ask questions. Critical questions, being able to enhance  should be the ultimate answer to the lack of this ability. The second strength I need to have to achieve my dream career is the ability to implement. This enables me to transform what I think into what I have done. I am currently doing projects on my own and with my club, hence improving my full-package skills. These abilities let me concentrate on the process of innovating without worrying about capabilities. I can start from coming up with ideas, prototyping, to finally make the product into reality and selling it.

I look upon myself in the near future to sit in front of a workstation and pondering the different aspects of my product. There should be countless difficulties and troubles, but I would be able to solve them with my abilities, imagination and implementation. Last, I saw myself showcasing how durable, multifunctional, and useful my products are, helping people around the globe to have better lives than the world before. Thank you for listening.
