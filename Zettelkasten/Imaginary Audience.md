# Imaginary Audience

Imaginary audience is a term which explains how teenagers normally overreact to other people’s opinion.

When I was in eighth grade, I had a classmate who was very conscious of his appearance. Any imperfection on his face was magnified a hundred times by himself. He spent a lot of time trying to impact us. However, he had not only failed many quizzes and exams but also became our class’s laughingstock for overdressing. He didn't get a good grade during the CAP exam, either. What I feel about him is that we shouldn't care about others’ comments too much to have a more flexible life.
