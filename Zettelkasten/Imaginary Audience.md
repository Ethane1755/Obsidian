# Imaginary Audience
#建中 

Imaginary audience is a term which explains how teenagers normally think about other people. We tend to overreact and keep too much of their opinions in mind.

When I was in eighth grade, I had a classmate who was very conscious of his appearance. Any imperfection on his face was magnified a hundred times by himself. He spent a lot of time trying to have an impact on us. However, he had not only failed many quizzes and exams, but also became our class's laughingstock for overdressing. He eventually didn't get a good grade during the CAP exam. What I feel about him is we shouldn't care about others' comments too much to have more a flexible live.
