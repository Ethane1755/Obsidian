The humans in the recycling plant identified themself as spies looking for story-filled garbage to share our experiences. Which helps to persuade people reducing use of plastic products. I was chosen for my participation in killing the big fish. Through telling my stories again and again, I felt apologetic for harming the ocean ecosystem. In order to make up for my sins, I decided to propagate the 3Rs: reduce, reuse, and recycle. This is why I’m standing here to tell you my exciting yet tragic adventure. To save the Earth, please stop manufacturing and disposing my biological brothers!
