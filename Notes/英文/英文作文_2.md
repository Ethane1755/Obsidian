Dear Sally,

I’m sorry to hear that you want to break up with me. We had gone through many up and downs in life together! I hope you seriously reconsider your decision.

For the most important matter, your addiction to me was all controlled by you. Every time you checked your notifications, phubbed friends and family, it was you who decided whether to look at them. You are truly the only one to control what you do, not me!

We can still do many great things together, Sally. We can still search for funny pictures, surf the infinite sea of information, and chat with other people. A bright future waits for us, don’t leave me like that!

Love,

John, your faithful servant.
